I want to create a Web App using only html, css and javascript.
It needs to already use icons and styling from open source free sources.
The site must be vibrant, funny and have nerdish vibe.
It must use all the best practices for a modern web based app.

Provide a prompt for the technical and UI aspects of the website. it will serve as base for the overall implementantion.
